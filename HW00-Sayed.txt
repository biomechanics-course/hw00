# Answer 4

Theta’’=wn*theta is the differential equation. We would make the following modifications

```
Change the initial conditions to be in terms of angles, angular velocities
theta0 = [0;-pi/6];  % initial condition for the pendulum in radians, where the current state is stored in vector y = [angle; angular velocity]

The ode function will be changed to
function dthetadt = f(t,theta)
dthetadt = [theta(2); theta(1)]; 
end

The call to the ode would now be: 
[t,theta] = ode23(@f,[tstart tfinal],theta0,options);


We could detect when the pendulum falls to the floor by setting up events for the angle reaching +pi/2 or -pi/2. 
```


# Answer 5

The ODE commands required are: 

```

tstart = 0;
tfinal = 30;
x0 = [1];
 
options = odeset('OutputFcn',@odeplot);  
 
   [t,x] = ode23(@f,[tstart tfinal],x0,options);


   function dxdt=f(t,x)
   dxdt=[-x];
   end 
```
